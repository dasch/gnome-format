README for gnome-format
-----------------

Simple formatting program for gnome. Supports only removable devices such as
USB-Sticks, SD-Cards and similar devices.

gnome-format currently requires:
  - glib-2.0 >= 2.10.0
  - gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0
  - dbus-glib-1
  - libgee-1.0
  - libglade-2.0
  - gmodule-2.0
  - gnome-desktop-2.0
  - libparted

If you want to compile it from SVN, you probably also need valac, the Vala
compiler.

//TODO: make a new website
See http://live.gnome.org/gnome-format
This site relates to a gnome-format written in C by Paul Betts. Unfortunately
Paul stopped working on it because of lack of time. This gnome-format here is a
complete rewrite in Vala (because I wanted to learn Vala :-)).
However his goals were the same, perhaps we can reuse the Gnome Live page.
